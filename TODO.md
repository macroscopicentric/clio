# Stuff That Needs To Happen To Have an MVP

## Stuff to Get Back Basic Functionality

1. verify Ruby upgrade, bundler version jump, and unpinned rspec version haven't caused basic runtime errors
2.

## Stuff That Would Be Nice to Automate

1. identifying when you need a twitter archive
2. going to fetch the twitter archive
3. set up some sort of cron/perma process?

## Expected Basic MVP functionality

1. add an actual database lol, instead of just saving to csv (open question: actually stick to postgres as originally proposed?)
2. add new platforms (Wordpress, Instagram, Tiktok?, Tumblr?)
3. actually build out the SocialMediaBackup class as a layer between the bin script and the Twitter class.
